# S3 Static Website Hosting - College Admission Form

This project demonstrates how to host a static website on AWS S3 for a college admission form. It utilizes an HTML form (`clg.html`) to collect admission data, and an error page (`errorfile.html`) to handle invalid URLs.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to create a static website hosted on AWS S3 for educational institutions to collect admission-related information from prospective students. It leverages AWS S3â€™s static website hosting capabilities, ensuring a cost-effective, scalable, and secure way to deliver static content.

## Features

- **College Admission Form**: A simple HTML form (`clg.html`) for collecting admission data.
- **Error Handling**: A custom error page (`errorfile.html`) that shows a user-friendly message when a URL is entered incorrectly.
- **Public Access**: Configured with appropriate bucket policies to allow public access to the hosted website.

## Usage

- Access the static website URL generated by AWS S3 to view the admission form.
- Submit the form and experience the error page when visiting non-existent URLs.
